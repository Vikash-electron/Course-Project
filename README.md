# Curse-Project
This is a project completed as a part of the IE643 (Deep Learning - Theory and Practice) course at IIT Bombay.

In this project, the main aim is to find an optimal Neural Network for a given dataset for a particular task.
For this task, first, a model zoo is created using different (datasets, models, accuracy) pairs, and a cross-model latent space is learned.
